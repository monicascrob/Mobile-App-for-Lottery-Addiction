# Mobile app for Lottery Addiction

A medical institute for preventing and treating gambling addiction wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help 
lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. They have a team of engineers to build it, 
but need help creating the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.

For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the 6/49 lottery and help users answer the following 
questions:
 - What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
 - What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any number)?
 - What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or htree, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?
 
The institute wants us to use data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. The data set has data 
for 3665 drawings from 1982 to 2018, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset)


We wrote four main functions:

- one_ticket_probability() — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket
- check_historical_occurrence() — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set
- multi_ticket_probability() — calculates the probability for any number of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816
- probability_less_6() - takes in an integer between 2 and 5 and prints information about the chances of winning 
depending on the value of that integer

The next step would be getting feedback about our first app and find ways to improve it or add new features.
